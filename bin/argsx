usage: ${0##*/} [-h] LAST FIRST [ARGS]

Supose you want to create hardlinks of lots of files using find, xargs and ln.
Without argsx you would need to use the \`-I{}' option which makes xargs
execute one ln command for each file find prints. If find prints a zillion
files, xargs will execute ln a zillion times. This is a big waste of
performance, specially if you have an old machine. Using argsx, xargs would
execute about MANY times less commands, depending on your OS type,
configuration and on the found files.

Using the command below, specifically in this example, xargs executes about
15800 times the ln command:

  $ find /orig-dir -type f -print0 | xargs -0 -I{} ln -s {} /dest-dir

Using argsx, xargs executes ln only 7 times:

  $ find /orig-dir -type f -print0 | xargs -0 argsx /dest-dir ln -s

The command that will be executed is the second argument passed to argsx. The
last argument passed to the executed command is the first argsx argument. The
subsequent arguments are passed to the command before the last.

If you want to contribute to the development of this script, please help on
improving this description/usage message.
